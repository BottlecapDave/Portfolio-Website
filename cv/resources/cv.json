	"Profile": "I am a proficient, hardworking and loyal person with 7 years of commercial experience. I aim to develop efficient, clean and easily maintainable code primarily in the C# language. I also expand this philosophy to any new languages I may be exposed to. I am interested in learning new technologies outside of work, which has lead to my recent roles at MixRadio and REPL Group through the self learning of Windows application development and Xamarin.\n\nI am seeking a role where I can take my existing experience and use it to develop new and interesting experiences, as well as expand my capabilities where possible.",
