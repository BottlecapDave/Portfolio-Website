				<p>This privacy policy's aim is to be as transparent as possible about what this application will do with the information on your phone when used (either directly on indirectly) and the data stored with the Picasa services that the application will be interacting with.
				<p style="text-decoration: italic">Effective as of 4th July 2016</p>
				<h2>Personal Data On Your Phone</h2>
				<p>This application will monitor the contents of the camera roll album on your phone to determine new photos. If you have elected for this application to back up your camera roll, then this information will be used to determine which photos require backing up to the Picasa services. These photos will not be backed up elsewhere.</p>
				<p>This application will send any photo that has been elected by the user to be shared via this application (explicitly or implicitly, directly or indirectly) to the users elected account to a location of their choosing. No photos will be uploaded anywhere else other than to the Picasa services.</p>
				<p>The application will not alter or tamper with any data stored on the phone. When the application creates scaled versions of photos (based on request from the user), temporary copies will be made locally to the phone and the original photos will remain untouched.</p>
				<h2>Personal Data On Picasa Services</h2>
				<p>This application will use authentication mechanisms as outlined by Google, using OAuth mechanisms to ensure your personal account details are kept safe and that this application only gains access to content that is neccessary for its purpose. We have taken steps to ensure that any authentication keys that are stored are stored safely as per guidelines laid out by <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/develop/ff402533%28v=vs.105%29.aspx#BKMK_Dataencryption">Microsoft</a>.<p>
				<p>This application will only download data from the Picasa services when prompted to do so by the user (either directly or indirectly). The downloaded data will be stored locally on the phone.</p>
				<h2>Geopositioning Of The User</h2>
				<p>This application will not track the users location directly. However, the application will upload photos taken on the device (with either direct on indirect permission of the user) to the Picasa services which may contain geo position data embedded in the photos.</p>
				<h2>Advertisements</h2>
				<p>This application will monetize via the inclusion of advertisements. By using the application, you agree to any data that may be provided to the advertisement suppliers, which may include the tracking of your uses across applications.</p>
				<h2>Picasa Web Albums</h2>
				<p>By using this application, you will be using the Picasa services. For more information on their privacy policy, visit their <a href="https://support.google.com/picasa/topic/1689812?hl=en-GB&ref_topic=1689804">website</a>.
